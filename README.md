# javascript

I don't know much about Javascript, but I thought I would start learning.  JS is
everywhere, and I need some fluency with it.  So I'm starting some baby projects
with the language.

I've added about 25 projects here now.  I've completed the Skillcrush Web Dev blueprint
and now I'm working through the Thinkful Web Dev Prep Course.  I'm just about done with 
that, so I'll probably go on and do the entire course.  Who knew JS was such a blast!

I have to remind myself that this little language was designed to stay tiny.  It is 
extended through additional libraries, and there are many of these.  But in a way, JS
is sort of like working with a primitive language where you have to build your own 
toolbox full of range() methods and min() max() functions.  It's good discipline.  
That, and it uses object prototypes instead of OO inheritance.  It still does 
encapsulation, but it's just different I guess.  I'm still figuring this stuff out!
