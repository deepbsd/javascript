<h1>Project Euler, Problem 2:  Even Fibonacci Numbers</h1>


<p>
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p>

<p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>

<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.  </p>

<p>The even numbers of this Fibonacci sequence will appear below:</b>
