/*               Most Frequent Drill
In this drill, you need to implement a function named mostFrequentWord. This
function takes a single argument, words. Words is an array of lowercase
strings, with punctuation stripped out.

mostFrequentWord should return the word that appears the most times in words.
If there's a tie, it should return the word that comes first alphabetically.

We recommend using an object to keep track of word frequencies in this drill.

This drill features tests that automatically run when the JS Bin first loads
and when you click the "Run" button in the console. You'll know your code is
working when the tests pass.

Note: JSBin: http://jsbin.com/qiwedit/3/edit?js,console

<p>The assignment includes a built-in test for the function that you have to pass in order to complete.</p>
