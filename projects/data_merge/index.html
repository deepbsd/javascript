/*               Data Merge
Data merge
In this drill, you'll write a function called mergeDataStreams that merges
together data from two sources. The first data set is an array of objects that
look like this:

{
  id: 'aBcDeFgH',
  firstName: 'Juan',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 32
}
The second data set is an array of objects that looks like this

{
  id: 'aBcDeFgH',
  occupation: 'architect',
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'CityTown',
    Country: 'USA'
  }
}
Each item in the first dataset has a matching counterpart in the second dataset
with the same value for the id property.

To complete the challenge, your mergeDataStreams must return an array of objects
that merge together the values for a given id. So, for instance, the merged
version of the data above would be:

{
  id: 'aBcDeFgH',
  firstName: 'Juan',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 32,
  occupation: 'architect',
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'CityTown',
    Country: 'USA'
  }
}
mergeDataStreams should return an array of merged objects like this.

This drill features tests that automatically run when the JS Bin first loads
and when you click the "Run" button in the console. You'll know your code is
working when the tests pass.

Friendly advice: to complete this drill, you'll need a way to iterate over the
keys and values of your objects. One way to do this is using Object.keys(),
which we discussed in the previous reading.
